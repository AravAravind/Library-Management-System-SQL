# Library-Management-System-SQL
The Library Management System is designed to efficiently manage book borrowings, returns, and fines while enforcing borrowing restrictions. This system ensures smooth operations by implementing automated triggers in MySQL to handle key processes such as updating book availability, imposing late return fines, and preventing over-borrowing.
